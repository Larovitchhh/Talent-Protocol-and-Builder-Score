# Talent-Protocol-and-Builder-Score
Talent Protocol represents a groundbreaking initiative in the sphere of professional reputation management, particularly within the blockchain ecosystem. It serves as an open, verifiable system designed to highlight and reward individuals who are actively 'building' in the Web3 space. Whether you're a developer, artist, or any other kind 

What is the Builder Score?

The Builder Score is a dynamic metric that aggregates various credentials from your professional activities across different platforms, translating them into a score between 0 and 100. This score is calculated based on three main categories of credentials:

Identity: Credentials that verify you as a real person or entity, separating genuine builders from bots or sybil accounts. 
Activity: Metrics based on your interaction and value addition in the ecosystem, distinguishing active contributors from mere participants.
Skills: Specific competencies or achievements that showcase your expertise in particular areas of Web3 development, like coding, design, or community building.

The score not only reflects your current standing but also grows with your contributions, making it a living testament to your professional journey in the blockchain world.

How to Get a Good Builder Score

Here are some steps and strategies to enhance your Builder Score on Talent Protocol:

1. Verify Your Identity

Secure Identity Credentials: Begin by connecting and verifying your identity through platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, or other Web3 identity providers such as ENS or Farcaster. This step adds points to your Identity category, potentially granting you a "Human Checkmark" if your score in this category reaches 20 or higher.


2. Engage Actively

Participate in Ecosystem Activities: Join hackathons, contribute to open-source projects, or engage with community events. Platforms like ETHGlobal or Base Buildathons can add significant points under the Activity category. Your active participation in these events not only boosts your score but also your reputation within the community.


3. Showcase Your Skills

Highlight Your Expertise: If you have skills in coding, particularly in blockchain development, ensure your contributions on platforms like GitHub are well-documented. Similarly, if you're a designer or marketer, your work on platforms like Lens or Farcaster can be leveraged. Each skill or project can contribute to your Skills credential, which has no cap, meaning the more you showcase, the higher your score can go.


4. Use Talent Protocol Tools

Mint Your Talent Passport Onchain: By minting your Talent Passport onchain, you're not only making your credentials tamper-proof but also increasing your score by demonstrating commitment to your professional reputation. This involves a one-time fee but adds points to your score as it shows your dedication to maintaining an accurate, verifiable professional identity.


5. Stay Updated and Re-engage

Regular Updates: Since the Builder Score is dynamic, regularly update your credentials. New partnerships, projects, or skills should be added to keep your score reflecting your latest achievements. 
Re-Mint Your Passport: To keep your onchain reputation current, it's advisable to refresh your Talent Passport snapshot every few months. This ensures that your score remains up-to-date and relevant to ecosystem apps looking to verify your credentials.


6. Leverage the $TALENT Token

Earn and Use $TALENT: Engaging with the $TALENT token can further your score. Staking tokens or using them for various services within the ecosystem can both increase visibility and directly impact your Builder Score.


Conclusion

Talent Protocol offers a novel approach to professional reputation by providing a decentralized, transparent, and verifiable system through the Builder Score. By actively participating, showcasing your skills, and maintaining your digital identity, you can significantly enhance your standing within the Web3 community. Remember, the journey to a high Builder Score is continuous, reflecting not just where you've been but where you're headed in your professional life.
